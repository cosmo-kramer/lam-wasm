	PDS: It would be somewhat cleaner if this stuff were collected into a

		type state = {
			funcs_code : string;	(* or string list with an eventual concatenation *)
			init_global : string;
			exports : string;
		}

	and the translation consumed a state (and produced a new
	state). As things are written, you have to remember to clear
	the references if you decide to translate two modules in one
	run of the program.

	All of these could accumulate string list, rather than string,
	leaving the concatenation to the end. (You can concatenate n
	characters in time O(n), but the way you do it is O(n^2).)

	PDS: Sequential composition need not be part of the language.
	In the call-by-value STLC we can encode let expressions:

		let x = e1 in e2 := (Î»x. e2) e1

	and then we can encode sequential composition:

		e1; e2 := let x = e1 in e2	(* where x not free in e2; see ./toy_typechecker/var.mli:/fresh *)

	The parser can handle e1; e2 without cluttering the language.

(*
	PDS: This appears to be dead code. I think I see what you're
	doing here and I wonder if there is a cleaner way. Not all
	source variables need correspond to target local variables. In
	the source language, we have one class of variables (bound in
	declarations, let expressions, and lambdas). The variables
	bound in declarations compile to stuff outside any WA function
	body. Rather than resort to yet more state, a cleaner way
	might be to enrich our notion of variables with a bit (bound
	by a declaration or not). I used a record in
	toy_typechecker/var.ml:/var_info to support this sort of
	compile-time distinction.

(*
	PDS: It's a bit ugly to grow the heap N times rather than to
	grow it once by 4N bytes. Also, consider calling a WA function
	high_alloc : i32 -> i32 rather than inline its body. The
	reason is you can then rewrite high_alloc (if you choose) to
	dynamically grow the linear memory when it is full.

	Also, what's the invariant on dynamic_heap_ctr?
	It looks like you're doing the equivalent of
		p += 4; mem[p] = closure
	rather than
		mem[p] = closure; p += 4
	both here and your code for references. Even if your code is
	correct, it is surprising and you should add a comment
	explaining why it's not wrong (e.g., a top of file comment
	describing run-time invariants and allocation).

	Also also, you have not accounted for low integrity closures
	(as far as I can tell). The way to do that is to first
	allocate a high-integrity closure (like you're doing) and then
	to use dynamic sealing. If that's unclear, ask Deepak or me to
	explain.
